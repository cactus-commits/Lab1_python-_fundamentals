# Python Fundamentals - DNA Sequence Analysis

Parsing and analyzing raw DNA sequence data using Python fundamentals — file I/O, dictionaries, loops, and matplotlib.

Built as part of my data engineering studies. The dataset comes from simplified DNA sequences (A, T, C, G letters) — no biology background needed to understand the code.

---

## Stack
Python, Matplotlib

---

## What it does

Reads raw `.txt` files containing DNA sequences, counts the frequency of each DNA letter per sequence, and generates a bar chart for each one. Task 2 extends this into a reusable function that handles more complex multi-line sequence files.

---

## How to Run
```bash

---

*First lab in my data engineering studies — focused on Python basics: file reading, loops, dictionaries, and building toward reusable functions.*
